# Weather App

## Description

The **Weather App** allows users to quickly search for any city and view real-time weather information. It provides
essential weather data such as the current temperature, weather conditions (e.g., *Cloudy*, *Sunny*, *Rainy*), daily
minimum and maximum temperatures, and wind speed.

Users can also manage their search history: delete previously searched cities or undo a deletion if it was done by
mistake.

When the user navigates to the main weather screen, the app requests access to their geolocation and automatically
displays the weather data for their current location.
